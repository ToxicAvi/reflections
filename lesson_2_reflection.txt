Q:What happens when you initialize a repository? 
Why do you need to do it?

A:When i initialize a repo it creates a hidden file called .git 
with metadata about the repo, and basically turn a regular 
directory into a repo. I need to do that so that i can use 
version control on the directory, tracking all the files in it.

Q:How is the staging area different from the working directory 
and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

A:the staging area is sort of a meta-area or a temporary area
since it only represents then files that are going to be commited.
It offers us a way of controling our commits even more in detail
to make them as logical as possible.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit
per logical
change?
